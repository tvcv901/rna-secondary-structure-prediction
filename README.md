# CS F364 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) Assignment

## RNA Secondary Structure Prediction (Dynamic Programming Approach)

### Directory Structure

`data` folder - contains NDB Test Cases and Timing Analysis data

`plots` folder - contains plot for Timing Analysis

`resources` folder - contains resources for the assignment

`visualization` folder - contains `visualizer.py` python program to visualize the secondary structure

`Molecule.cpp` - contains implementation for the dynamic programming approach

### Steps to run and visualize the algorithm

1. Open Command Prompt or Powershell and run `.\molecule.bat` to input an RNA sequence.

2. To visualize the output,

   `cd visualization`

   `python visualizer.py`
